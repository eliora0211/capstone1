    <h3>CAREER OBJECTIVE</h3>
    <p>
        I have an interest in programming and coding, i feel like my ability was not used to the outmost in my current workplaces. I hope that by learning
        from this bootcamp, i will kickstart my ability in programming. I always felt like my calling is here, but i never had
        the chance to really learn it properly. I did learn for a while on and off but never really took it seriously and far.
        And I'm open to learn anything new.
